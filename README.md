## DOM Level 2:
DOM Level 2 introduced the foolowing new modules of the DOM to deal with new types of interfaces:
- **DOM Views** - Describes interfaces to keep track of the various views of a document. ( the document before and after CSS styling).
- **DOM Events** - Describes interfaces for events and event handling.
- **DOM Style** - Describes interfaces to deal with CSS based styling of elements.
- **DOM Traversal and Range** - Describe interfaces to traverse and manipulate a document tree.

## DOM Level 3:
DOM Level 3 further extends the DOM with the introduction of methods to load and save documents in a uniform way and methods to validate a document. In level 3, the DOM Core is extended to support all of XML1.0, including XML Infoset, XPath, and XML Base.
